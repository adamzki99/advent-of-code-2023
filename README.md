# Advent of Code 2023

In this year's edition of Advent of Code, I will continue with the lessons I learned from the [2022 edition](https://github.com/adamzki99/advent-of-code-2022).

Recently, I finished reading "The Clean Coder" by Robert C. Martin, where he speaks highly of test-driven development. So, I will try to achieve as high of a test coverage as possible for this rendition of Advent of Code.
This will be in conjunction with a "proper" development environment. With experience developing within the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) project, I got familiar with the concept of dev-containers with VS-Code.
So, a dev container will also be included in this repository.

In short, I hope to get familiar with the following:

- Test-driven development
- Development containers
- GO
